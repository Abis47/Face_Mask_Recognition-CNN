# Face_Mask_Recognition-CNN
Face Mask Detection through WebCam using CNN Model

I used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow.keras, and cv2 libraries to do Image Data Augmentation, Image transformation, Image Pixel Normalization, and making model.

I made CNN Model for Recognizing Face Mask through WebCam.
